# Digit Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning solution for digit classification, typically using the MNIST dataset. The goal of the project is to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from images and automatically classify them using a trained model.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training using neural networks (e.g., CNN)
- Evaluation and metrics reporting
- Visualization of predictions
- Easily extensible for other image classification tasks

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow 
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medikondasumanth/digit-classification.git
cd digit-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
2. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```
3. Predict new digits:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image path_to_image.png
    ```

## Dataset

This project uses the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits.

## Results

- Model Accuracy: 99% 
- Sample predictions are shown in the `results/` directory
